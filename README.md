The bundler module used for this SPA is webpack, for this project we have 2 templates.

The first one that allows us to display the most expected video games for the coming year, also we have a search bar that allows us to search for the video game of our choice and a sorting system by platform.

The second template allows us to display the information of the game when we click on its name when we are on the first template.
